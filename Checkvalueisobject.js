//In JavaScript, we can check the type of value 
//typeof operator: This is used to identify the type of variable. 
//It returns a variable type. It is the easiest way to check the type of the variable.
// It works for some variables, but it did not identify the exact type of variable.

let k = {Name:'gfg',Country:'India'};
let k0 = new Set()
let k1 = [1,2,3];

console.log( typeof k )
console.log( typeof k0 )
console.log( typeof k1 )
console.log( typeof k2 )
